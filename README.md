## Technologies Used

## How the project works

- Generating a random number between 1 and 20 which is not shown by default
- Allows user to input a number
- User can press the Check button to check if the user guess matches the random number
- Score starts at 20, each incorrect guess lowers it by 1
- If guess is too low or too high it shows an apropriate message (too high or too low)
- If guess is correct it changes the background color, shows a success message, checks if the score is a new highscore and if it's the case it changes it
- User can press Try Again button to reset everything to default, except Highscore
- Highscore resets on page reload
